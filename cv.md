                "In 2019, to be a truly impactful information professional, it is no longer adequate to solely be a competent technologist. The easy problems have been solved; the rest lie on multi-domain interfaces."

                Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen asserted in his canonical 2011 WSJ op-ed that <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">"software is eating the world."</a> Good software is now fundamental to the success of any venture of scale, tech-centric or not. It is my conviction that—as society grows ever more dependent on its information systems—we need not merely a larger quantity of technologists, but more technically-literate, interdisciplinary, open-minded, <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/speaking-truth-to-power-reflections-on-a-career-at-microsoft-90f80a449e36">antidogmatic</a>, deliberate, curious and conscientious architects of our collective digital future.

                I love understanding and decoding systems of all kinds: formal and natural; processes, routines, structures and institutions, but also culture, histories, languages and traditions. I strive for excellence in all these domains, and as such, a workplace which fosters and enables such an objective.

                <br />
                <h4>
                I strive for a workplace where one can learn from a diverse set of colleagues, one of open and nuanced exchange of ideas, maximum empathy, mutual support, respect, and uncompromising ethical foundation. I hope not only to be able to achieve my best work, but to help others do the same—which I strongly believe is a subset of great work.

# Four Things I Wish I Knew Before Four Years at University

## 1: Academic Metrics ∝ In Vivo Capability 

> You can really cruise through CS without actually trying very hard and get good grades without learning all that much. It's also laughably easy to cheat, and dishonesty is rampant. 



## 2: Human Connections ≫ Anything Else 

> You don't actually go to university to study. I'm completely serious. This applies even more to elite institutions. It's trite, but it's not *what* you know, but *who* you know. What do you think networking events are so important for? 



## 3: Don't Put Your Life On Hold

> Getting a letter in the mail every year showing you how many more thousands you're borrowing to get this education that you barely feel like you're keeping up with can create a certain kind of mindset. It's a mindset that goes along the lines of: "I've already sunk x capital into this journey and if I fuck up now, all of my capital and effort put in so far is completely wasted." The logical conclusion of this idea is that, at the expense of everything else, you need to concentrate solely and completely on your academic performance. 

Not only is this wrong; it's extremely unhealthy. 

## 4: Don't use Autopilot; Focus on the Bigger Picture

## 5: Bonus Lecture - Superman Doesn't Exist.

> University is a weird time of life. You're an adult, sure, and might even somehow be keeping up with a job on the side and doing other adulty things like renting an apartment.

Not only do you have to adjust, but you also have to learn the hidden rules and unwritten understandings of society.

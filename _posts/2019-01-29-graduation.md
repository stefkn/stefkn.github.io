# Four Things I Wish I Knew Before Four Years at University

*because maybe if I `npm install` at 88loc/h this will travel back into my past and change the course of history*

## 1: Academic Metrics ∝ In Vivo Capability

> You can really cruise through CS without actually trying very hard and get good grades without learning all that much. It's also laughably easy to cheat, and dishonesty is rampant. 

This might sound like an elaborate [humblebrag](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humblebrag) but I guarantee you, it's not. I strongly believe that most of the content covered by the large majority of undergraduate computer science degrees can be learned by almost anyone. I want to emphasize that I'm not saying _anyone_ can finish a CS degree, but only that _anyone can understand the vast majority of the most important concepts_. More theoretical and pure-maths stuff is perhaps more challenging, but the brass-tacks knowledge (how does binary work? how does computer compute? what is a program and how do I write one?) that one needs to get to start writing real code only requires the right motivation. Everything above the theoretical level was built by us humans, and the systems wouldn't be very useful if they were monolothic ancient talismans understood only by the wise greybeards of Unixathuúìn that nobody should touch for fear of breaking all the dependencies forever.<sup>[1](#note1)</sup> 

Because of this, if you have the gift of some small amount of ability or are just quick to pick up new things (or maybe you even started coding long before your undergrad CS course designed to teach undergrads with no experience at all) it's very easy to cruise through with a very comfortable level of effort. That's fine, but I think that many people choose this path out of it being default, and never stop to consider what they might be missing out on by not extending themselves further. That's to say nothing of those who have the fortune (misfortune?) of discovering that the Intro to Programming lecturer's _super-smart machine-learning code plagiarism detector_ isn't as sophisticated as he wanted everyone to think, and that the guy in the practice lab who figured out an `O(1)` solution to the problem is pretty proud and _really_ wants to show everyone how much of a genius he is by showing anyone who asks his awesome helper function that trivialises the input problem, and that the grad students who are supposed to be manually checking these things have neither the time nor the inclination to compare every single submission from hundreds of undergrads. 

All of this is to say that I think many undergrads can forget that "doing well in university" really has very little to do with getting good grades in your classes. There are many people getting decent to excellent grades in their classes who, truthfully, are not gaining the maximum attainable value from their expensive university education; this can be for both totally honest and acceptable reasons to less savory ones. At the end of the day, with a domain like CS, the general trajectory is aligned with the idea that you're going to go into industry applying what you learn in some manner whether that be in a very rock-face engineering role or something more data-y or management-y. Good grades might help you get your foot in the door, but the most important thing is whether you can truly walk the walk---and you're the only one that can really know whether you can. 


## 2: Human Connections ≫ Anything Else 

> You don't actually go to university to study. I'm completely serious. This applies even more to elite institutions. It's trite, but it's not *what* you know, but *who* you know. What do you think networking events are so important for? 



## 3: Don't Put Your Life On Hold

> Getting a letter in the mail every year showing you how many more thousands you're borrowing to get this education that you barely feel like you're keeping up with can create a certain kind of mindset. It's a mindset that goes along the lines of: "I've already sunk x capital into this journey and if I fuck up now, all of my capital and effort put in so far is completely wasted." The logical conclusion of this idea is that, at the expense of everything else, you need to concentrate solely and completely on your academic performance. 

Not only is this wrong; it's extremely unhealthy. 

## 4: Don't use Autopilot; Focus on the Bigger Picture

## 5: Bonus Lecture - Superman Doesn't Exist.

> University is a weird time of life. You're an adult, sure, and might even somehow be keeping up with a job on the side and doing other adulty things like renting an apartment. But essentially, you've only just graduated into adulthood, and unless you were a very mature kid, there's a lot of culture shock. Not only do you have to adjust, but you also have to learn the hidden rules and unwritten understandings of society. 

I think most of us

Summer rolls around again. It's hot. 

For many millenials, myself included, the associates of summer and summers past—the heat, long days, scents, the flora and the light—no doubt trigger a sense of nostalgia for childhood and teenagerdom. (indulge me here my banal over-generalization) 

While we all percieve this reminiscence in ways unique to our personal histories, there remain certain constants; at the risk of irritating the physicists amongst us we may metaphorically call them nodes on a standing wave. To stretch the metaphor, the standing wave can be constructed from the superposition of all the experiences making up the generational collective conscious.

Too much abstraction is bad for the health, so I will provide examples.  Stay with me here.

## Internet Detritus

Millenials, having come of age well into the *Age of Information*, are bound together globally with shared experiences of a slightly different sort from those of previous generations. The advent of information dissemination technologies of increasing sophistication and bandwidth<sup>[1](#note1)</sup> allowed a certain prototypical form of this global collective conscious as each generation *"experienced"* events of global significance in greater and greater *"resolution"*<sup>[2](#note2)</sup>. However, my suggestion is that the millenial generation is one of the first to have come of age in a time when such information transfer (and physical transposition) was, basically, very cheap. This meant there no longer needed to be a concerted effort to disseminate artifacts of culture.<sup>[3](#note3)</sup>

By the time I was 8 years old (2004) we were well into the age of the modern internet and—while bandwidth was still lacking for good video streaming—sites like eBaum's World, Homestar Runner, DeviantArt and Newgrounds, where anyone with an iMac G3 and Macromedia Flash 5 could upload Tom Cruise-bashing animations to be seen by the world, were already well established and would become very prevalent in my small cultural world a few years on. 

While the specifics differ, there is something that transcends generations about nostalgia.

### Footnotes

<a name="note1">1</a>: The printing press, the telegram, the radio, the telephone, the television and so on. 

<a name="note2">2</a>: I use the term "resolution" in a loose way. Let's imagine the Vietnam War took place in the early 1800s (It's in my USA-LoTR crossover fanfiction) before the popularisation of the camera. Putting aside the effects of time, how differently would the collective perception of the war be without the daily pictographic and videographic vicarious experiences at home? Now think of the last time the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center came up in conversation. I would guess one of the first phrases to be along the lines of, "I remember exactly where I was, I was at X and Y called to tell me to turn on the TV..." Now think of the Christchurch Masjid attacks—many people watched those events live too, but with an important distinction: the perpetrator was the broadcaster; it was first-person, the ultimate in vicarious resolution. 

<a name="note3">3</a>: Generations past may argue that they too posessed global cultural experiences, such as British, French, Russian or American films with global distribution, say, *Gone With The Wind (1939)* or *Ben-Hur (1959)*. They may also point to literature and fine art. I make a distinction here in that these artifacts are products (in the mercantile sense), or second-order products. I define second-order products as reproductions or derivations of objects (which themselves may or may not be products) intended to be exchanged for capital. Not only are such artifacts products, but they have passed the scrutiny (and censorship) of legions of experts and professionals: in the case of film, executive producers, DPs, directors, executives and managers, and so on. In the case of literature, publishers and editors. After the production, for anywhere where distribution was a non-trivial matter, someone had to decide it was worth taking the artifact to the place to sell or exchange. I think the bleeding of "latent" cultural fragments, artifacts often with little perceiveable value, not made for personal profit and not having cleared some appraisal of worth: dumb little flash animations, pictures, sound clips, fanart or weird GIFs and copypasta stories... these are mostly unique to the collective millenial experience.

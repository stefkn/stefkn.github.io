Such is the sing-along brag of the computer in *Don't Hug Me I'm Scared 4*, the fourth episode in the live-action animation surreal horror webseries *Don't Hug Me I'm Scared* from British filmmakers Becky Sloan and Joseph Pelling. If you're not familiar with DHMIS, you're welcome. 

DHMIS is a perfect blend of the Lynchian uncanny, elements of the contemporary Gothic, a touch of Sesame Street/Barney hauntology, incredible and varied technicolor art direction and genuinely catchy song-writing; all of these elements are wrapped up in a mysterious overarching narrative that comments on, among other subjects:

<style>ul { padding-left: 3em; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;}</style>

 - mass media and the commercialisation of children's television, 
 - the indoctrination of children by parents and media, 
 - conformity, societal and cultural orthodoxy, 
 - misinformation, and its weaponisation by special interest groups, 
 - the hijacking of science by charlatans
 - heteronormativity and cultism
 - technology and social media

Recently, I exercised my privilege to join what some now call the League of the New Luxury: I deleted my Facebook, Snapchat, WeChat and Instagram presences. I also intend to delete my WhatsApp, Line, Tumblr, and a multitude of other online personas. Twitter stays, but probably not for much longer. LinkedIn, the one I detest more than all of the aforementioned combined, sadly must stay—at least until I've made my seed-stage stock option unicorn exit. Similarly—while I'm not sure these count as "social apps"—I have to keep my HackerRank, Kaggle and StackOverflow for professional and career-development reasons. I'm not erasing my online life completely, but I've undertaken a thorough and critical look at each of the services I'm affiliated with and completed a value calculation as to whether what I gain from each service is greater than what they gain from me. Personally, having never done such an exercise, the results were striking. How many things do we sign up for once and then forget about forever? Do you remember what kind of data permissions you gave that one service you signed up for once via a 3rd-party auth provider like Facebook just to use a todo list app? a mobile game? a fitness tracker? a meditation timer? a memorization app? Has the well-intentioned startup that made the app subsequently gone into administration, in which all its old employees fired, its assets stripped, and its data purchased by a shadowy data-mining and business analytics and remarketing firm based in Karachi? 

<!-- | Service      | Value         | Price         |

Everyone who learns about my social-media purge immediately needs to know: *Why?* For the first few who asked, I would reply with some vague allusion to mental health, privacy concerns, fears about the effects of misinformation and advertising on our society and democracy, a sense of disillusionment with it all and a not insignificant desire to be a bit of a rebel. Also, [Facebook](https://www.zdnet.com/article/over-540-million-facebook-records-found-on-exposed-aws-servers/) and Co. just [keep](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/facebook-hack-data-breach.html) on [appearing](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-user-passwords-in-plain-text-for-years/) in the [news](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/instagram-password-leak-millions/) for [very](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/facebook-photo-bug/) bad [reasons](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/technology/whatsapp-facebook-jan-koum.html). <sup>[1](#note1)</sup> But there are also higher-level reasons regarding the meaning of human communication and relation, and how their  digitalisation is changing the fundamentals of these ancient human functions. 

I want to stress that I'm still going to partake in online "life"—I'm not going full-Amish—but as far as possible, it's going to be on my terms: my data and my content means my design, explicit permission and my control. I'm going to communicate more deliberately, and strengthen the important, beautiful relationships in my personal and professional lives that generate mutual fulfilment and ruthlessly excise everything else. I'm going to eschew services that interleave content with noise and manipulation. There's not enough time in the day or space in my head. Join me! Refuse to fit into a 1080x1080 <sup>[2](#note2)</sup> square!

Having spent a while thinking on such things, and having been asked a few times, I've resolved to crystalize those feelings in a post, so that I could just lazily point the next inquirer to my blog. They say the laziest developers are the best ones. Anyway, if you're reading this via that *lead generation pathway*  then, welcome. This would be the way I explain myself with no marginal cost. I'm going to come back to *Don't Hug Me*, but first, an aside about a guy called Wiener. Perhaps **The** guy called Wiener. 



<br />

## The Human Use of Human Beings

<img style="width: 40%; float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;" class="bookcover" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/thehumanuseofhumanbeings_weiner.jpg?w=624&ssl=1" />

> "When there is communication without need for communication, merely so that someone may earn the social and intellectual prestige of becoming a priest of communication, the quality and communicative value of the message drop like a plummet."\\
> **N. Wiener**, 1965

Did this guy just predict the Instagram Influencer, Content Farming and Clickbait at around the same time that The Beatles released *Rubber Soul?* Yes, he did, and that's probably the *least*  impressive thing he ever did. 

Wiener graduated high school at 11, got a BA in mathematics from Tufts at 14, started studying Zoology at Harvard before moving to Cornell for philosophy and then went back to Harvard where he did more philosophy and got his Ph.D. in mathematical logic at 17. His dissertation work was on linking the axioms of set theory to ordered pairs, and a simplification of his work is still in use to this very day. 

Not satisfied with making a contribution to the fundamentals of mathematical logic before he was 20, he then went to Cambridge and studied under Bertrand Russel and G. H. Hardy, and also to Göttingen to study under David Hilbert and Edmund Landau. Together they would work on yet more fundamental contributions to such domains as Brownian motion, the Fourier Integral, Dirichlet's problem, harmonic analysis and Tauberian theorems. (I don't claim to know what any of those are.) From here, he took up his best known position as a legendary professor of mathematics at MIT where he made great contributions to information theory, automation, robotics, computer control, and created the field of cybernetics. He helped put together a cognitive science research team which included Walter Pitts, credited with developing the mathematical model for the first neural network.<sup>[3](#note3)</sup> In all, one of the intellectual giants of the 20th century. 

So, what could such an illustrious academic have to say about social media?

## Wow, we're all computery

> One of the things that I’ve been concerned about is this illusion where you think that you’re in this super-democratic open thing, but actually it’s exactly the opposite; it’s actually creating a super concentration of wealth and power, and disempowering you. \\
> **J. Lanier**, 2018, in [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/jaron-lanier-interview-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-internet.html)

So, that brings me back to Don't Hug Me I'm Scared. While it never overtly references social media, as with all of the oblique references DHMIS makes, I think it's fairly plain to see that (specifically with the *"digital style"* quip, and accompanying snappy camera guy) social networks are the subject of the final sequence. It's also a brilliant touch that the short starts with the characters looking towards the "world" for the answers, and instead the computer butts in and completely derails the situation. 

After getting digitized, starting at about 3:03, Red Guy asks, "in this digital world, what can we do?" to which the computer responds, "in the digital world, there's over three things to do..." 

<br />
### 1: Wow, look, a bar chart

> There’s this question of whether what you’re fighting for is something that’s really new and a benefit for humanity, or if you’re only engaged in a sort of contest with other people that’s fundamentally not meaningful to anyone else.\\
> **J. Lanier**, 2018, in [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/jaron-lanier-interview-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-internet.html)

The bar chart (and other subsequent data visualisations) shown through the first door is a visual tool for the comparison of variables. One could interpret this as the use of the computer to make spreadsheets and the like, but I suggest a different view; I think the variables being compared are us, when we anxiously check how many followers we have and who liked our latest Insta. As the sequence progresses, the charts become sad, and more abstract, until eventually they reduce to nothing. There is a sociological hypothesis called the *relative income effect*, which attempts to qualify the link between one's income and overall happiness:

> With respect to income and happiness, **what matters most is how much income a person has relative to his or her income comparison group.** \(For classic statements of the relative income effect, see Veblen \[1899\] and Duesenberry \[1949\]; for more recent contributions, see Frank \[1985, 1999\], Elster and Roemer \[1991\], and Layard \[2005, chap. 4\].\) \\
> **G. Firebaugh** and **M. B. Schroeder**, *'Does Your Neighbor’s Income Affect Your Happiness?'*, AJS. 2009 Nov;115(3):805-31.<sup>[5](#note5)</sup> (Emphasis mine.)

We have created digital machines for the mass-manufacturing of discontentment. 

Why? Because discontentment is the most efficient and effective driver of consumption. How? By enabling everyone from the poorest kid in rural Serbia<sup>[4](#note4)</sup> to billionaire Kylie Jenner compare themselves to each other, side by side, in the same context as their respective close friends and relatives. One of them has a social media management team, a PR firm, a professional photographer, photoshop wizard, hair stylist, makeup artist, image consultant, speech trainer, personal shopper, personal stylist, personal trainer, plastic surgeon, cosmetician, beauty therapist, chauffeur, dietician, and so on. One of them has none of these. A healthy, holistic outlook on one's situation this does not make, and a realistic *income comparison group* neither. The medieval peasant would have known very little about his feudal lord's lifestyle. Today, the regents pay people to document their lives in the most beautiful and tasteful manner to send you hourly updates with coupon codes with which to get 15% off of their brand of [all-natural detox cleanse skinny tea](https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a25846478/detox-teas-weight-loss/). 

<br />
### 2: Digital style!

I don't include the above video from a judgemental, "you superficial, narcissistic \*expletive\* \*misogynistic expletive\*..." stance. I'm not even against plastic surgery, it can be life-saving, life-affirming, especially for those of us unlucky enuogh to be born in bodies which do not reflect our mental projections of ourselves, or are involved in tragic accidents, or born with deformities. I am *lucky* to be able to divest myself so trivially from social media. For many, as Marla Frezza says in the video, it's an indispensible career tool and an immutable fixture of modern life. This piece is important for me because I know *exactly* what she means—I suffer from serious issues with body image and to see it reflected almost 1:1 in someone about three million times more beautiful than I confirms my belief that these problems are totally detached from the physical world. They are digital problems, made corporeal, coming out of the screen; they are mind viruses. Profitable mind viruses.

### 3: Digital dancing, hey this is fun!

We have established that social media is designed to enable everyone to compare and measure themselves up against a fabricated, manicured, perfected simalcrum of the lives of the most privileged individuals on the planet, alongside a similarly obsessively-curated and censored view of all of their friends and relatives. If only it ended there. 

Social media is evolving from an online service for human interaction, to a digital realm for, well, anything interaction. Increasingly convoluted and sophisticated methods of marketing and manipulation are invading the space faster than you can say ["brand Twitter"](https://qz.com/quartzy/1542797/snack-twitter-from-whoopie-pies-to-corn-nuts-is-rallying-around-a-depressed-sunnyd/), where you might see anything from an anthropomorphised snack brand, sugar-water firm or fast-food outfit pretend they have depression for [mind share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_share) and [impressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression_(online_media)).

It's not just Twitter, although that's where the examples are most egregious. Facebook's ["Real Name"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_real-name_policy_controversy) policy does not apply to Pages, nor to advertising. (Although, to their credit, thay have recently introduced more stringent advertising standards and transparency rules, especially for political adverts.)

We all participate in this grand digital dance, as shown in the final moments of Don't Hug Me 4. We dance in an inky blackness, unaware of what's happening around us, the focus groups and statisticians and data scientists behind the curtain, unaware of who we dance with, what we dance with, just trying to get noticed. We dance with other people, fake people, with brands, with trolls, with [50-Cent Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party) and [Glavset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency), with nation-states and [bots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bot) and Nazis. \([they prefer "race realist" now](https://datasociety.net/output/alternative-influence/)\) All watched over by the omniscient Algorithm, which hangs above us in the shadows, silently promoting and demoting, banning and revoking, cold, logical, stochastically optimising and perfecting so we dance for longer and longer.

> Youtube and Instagram stars draw you in with viral content and enviable abs, promising you that if you drink the juice, do the workout routine, learn how to use a hairdryer with perfect salon technique \(and if you’re finding it difficult this new product makes it SO much easier, use my code for a 15 percent discount!\) you can be the best version of yourself you can be. This is a lie, of course—the goal is not to be you, it’s to be them. You know this, and know it isn’t what you should think, but you cannot help how you feel. The insecurities burrowing deep under your skin and planting the desire to be someone else don’t even have to be internally consistent. Being a woman means you can stand in front of a mirror and simultaneously be upset that you’re not as skinny as a sportswear model and as curvaceous as a 1950s pinup girl. Your phone is filled with updates from the lives of beautiful women you do not know. Flick to the next image in your feed, past the girl with the Photoshopped manicure \(perhaps in reality, her nails, like yours, are bitten down\). The next post is about self-care. There’s a link to buy bath oils in the description.\\
> “It’s okay if all you did today was breathe,” promises a widely-shared image macro of a gentle talking pair of lungs. Well, I hate to break it to you, talking lungs, but it’s 2018. We’re supposed to be walking powerhouses of productivity, using every minute of our time to its best effect. In an economic environment where careers are precarious and competitive, young people are increasingly pressured to give up their free time to take on extracurriculars and unpaid projects “for their resume,” produce creative content “for exposure,” learn skills such as coding, scout for jobs on LinkedIn, write self-promoting posts about their personal qualities, and perhaps worst of all, attend godawful networking events, some of which don’t even have free canapés. Taking part in all this sounds unfair and exploitative, but you’re in a world where solidarity is just the name of a song from the Billy Elliot musical; if you won’t go along with it, there’s a line of brilliant, hungry graduates from top-name schools right behind you who will. It doesn’t stop with work either. This way of thinking about ourselves—constantly in need of self-improvement, constantly aware of our need to market ourselves as premium humans—seeps into our personal lives as much as our professional lives. On your way home from the office, perhaps you’ll flick through the apps on your smartphone, doing all the tasks you’ve assigned to yourself so you can be stronger, smarter, more attractive. *Have you walked the 10,000 steps today mandated by your Fitbit? Have you done your Duolingo practice? You’re falling behind with learning French. Learning French will make you more appealing to employers, and might also make you look sexy and mysterious on dates. Have you responded to that Tinder message? It wasn’t very interesting, but you can’t remember the last time you met a romantic prospect organically so you should really get around to responding. You need to think of a good joke first, though; if you come off as too generic they’ll be on to the next candidate. Have you finished that book for your book club? You’ll look like an idiot if you don’t know how it ends. Did you play the guitar today? Creativity is important. Have you checked the news? What if someone asks you about the situation in Myanmar? How’s your posture? Is it upright? Check your reflection in the window. Why are you slouching? Why are you so pale? Why are you so tired? Who is this person?*\\

> But then the algorithms have to maximize value from all the data that’s coming in. So they test use that data. And it just turns out as a matter of course, that the same data that is a positive, constructive process for the people who generated it — Black Lives Matter, or the Arab Spring — can be used to irritate other groups. And unfortunately there’s this asymmetry in human emotions where the negative emotions of fear and hatred and paranoia and resentment come up faster, more cheaply, and they’re harder to dispel than the positive emotions. So what happens is, every time there’s some positive motion in these networks, the negative reaction is actually more powerful. So when you have a Black Lives Matter, the result of that is the empowerment of the worst racists and neo-Nazis in a way that hasn’t been seen in generations. When you have an Arab Spring, the result ultimately is the network empowerment of ISIS and other extremists — bloodthirsty, horrible things, the likes of which haven’t been seen in the Arab world or in Islam for years, if ever. \\

There exists a well-understood mechanism by which certain activities, performed regularly, change the structure of the brain in a measureable way. 

> Using a 3 T MRI, we obtained structural and functional images in adolescent girls before and after practice on a visual-spatial problem-solving computer game, Tetris. After three months of practice, compared to the structural scans of controls, the group with Tetris practice showed thicker cortex, primarily in two areas: left BAs 6 and 22/38. \\
> **Richard J Haier, Sherif Karama, Leonard Leyba and Rex E. Jung**, BMC Research Notes 2009 <sup>[6](#note6)</sup>

This can be a good thing, as was found in the case of Tetris, where there was found to be evidence to support the proposal that playing Tetris could reduce the build-up of flashbacks from traumatic experiences.<sup>[7](#note7)</sup> This phenomenon, of engaging in an activity for long enough that it begins to pattern one's thoughts, mental images and dreams, is broadly referred to as the [Tetris effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect). 

I believe something similar is happening to us, the dancers in this digital party. It's not confined to one platform, it's the nature of the platforms themselves. Instant, always-on, [hyperscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperscale_computing), [hyperactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification), [hyperreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality), personalised, contstantly-connected, moderated,  monitored, quantified and confined. Ever accelerating, ever emerging, ever evolving, ever updating. It's an environment of godless hyper-darwinism, mixed with the postmodern<sup>[8](#note8)</sup>, irony-laced, nihilistic ideology fuelled by every new livestreamed terror attack and mass shooting, cheered along with every [coded meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah5MYGQBYRo) and [rare pepe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyYJmH9bHno). I feel blessed that I grew up as these systems were much tamer, less significant within the day-to-day milieu, just curious distractions. I can't imagine the pressure and angst I would feel as a younger person today, trying to keep up and to keep my head above water amongst all of this. 

I'm not sure if I would have made it.

> The argument is that social media hates your soul. And it suggests that there’s a whole spiritual, religious belief system along with social media like Facebook that I think people don’t like. And it’s also fucking phony and false. It suggests that life is some kind of optimization, like you’re supposed to be struggling to get more followers and friends. Zuckerberg even talked about how the new goal of Facebook would be to give everybody a meaningful life, as if something about Facebook is where the meaning of life is. \\
> It suggests that you’re just a cog in a giant global brain or something like that. The rhetoric from the companies is often about AI, that what they’re really doing — like YouTube’s parent company, Google, says what they really are is building the giant global brain that’ll inherit the earth and they’ll upload you to that brain and then you won’t have to die. It’s very, very religious in the rhetoric. And so it’s turning into this new religion, and it’s a religion that doesn’t care about you. It’s a religion that’s completely lacking in empathy or any kind of personal acknowledgment. And it’s a bad religion. It’s a nerdy, empty, sterile, ugly, useless religion that’s based on false ideas. \\

## What Can Be Done? 

Wow, that got pretty dark. It *is* pretty dark. But that doesn't mean it necessarily needs to stay this dark, or to get any darker. It's easy to complain from the sidelines, but I don't think it's fair unless I propose at least some ideas about how to improve things. Luckily, I have a few, but more importantly, people much cleverer than I also have lots of ideas—some of which are already in production. This is the point where I pitch you my new startup. 

<br />
### Identity & Access Management

One of Facebook's core functions that makes it such a powerful, widespread network is its Identity & Access Management system, referred to as [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/). This is an API that Facebook provides to third-parties which allows them to use a Facebook account as a stand-in for making an account directly with the third party. In this way, when someone who already has a Facebook account is signing up for a new service, there is reduced friction in [onboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding) this new customer as they do not need to go through the trouble of entering and verifiying a new email address and \(hopefully unique\) password. 

Can you see the issue here? This allows Facebook to become strongly-coupled in the identitiy verification process, in a service agreement that would otherwise have had nothing to do with Facebook, to provide an essential functionality that really could be achieved without Facebook's involvement. A prime example is the hundreds of millions of customers who have subscribed to Spotify through a Facebook Login. Because of limitations within the Login API, if you want to quit Facebook and make that Facebook-Spotify coupled Spotify account independent of Facebook... sorry. You're SOL. [Deleting your Facebook will render your account useless, with immediate effect \(regardless of any remaining paid subscription\) and irrecoverably delete all of your saved songs, playlists, likes, ratings, friends, and so on.](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Accounts/Delete-Facebook-Account-But-Keep-Spotify/td-p/224540) This isn't just annoying; I think it's wrong. Those obsessively-curated playlists are *your data*, that you *put in work* to make. Even if the songs themselves don't belong to you, you should be able to take that (meta) data and export it to any service you like. *(More on that in the next section: Data Silos, Governance and Control)* It creates totally unnecessary [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in).

I mentioned that, "the functionality really could be achieved without Facebook's involvement." Why is Facebook or Google the default arbiter for the mapping of real people to virtual accounts? The answer is basically just [first-mover advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage). There's a lot of [due diligence](https://en-gb.facebook.com/help/contact/183000765122339) and [administrative overhead](https://en-gb.facebook.com/help/hacked) associated with identity management that third parties can benefit from, basically at zero capital cost, when they use these third-party integrations. Facebook and Google are large and profitable enough that they can trivially eat these costs, smaller companies cannot afford to run large scale customer account support centres and government ID verification schemes.

### A Series of Tubes

> Ten movies streaming across that, that Internet, and what happens to your own personal Internet? I just the other day got… an Internet was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning on Friday. I got it yesterday. Why? Because it got tangled up with all these things going on the Internet commercially. \\
> **T. Stevens**, U.S. Sen., 2006

Let's imagine for a moment that the anarcho-capitalists reign supreme and we all live in self-soverign  enclaves governed by private corporations, a lá [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash). There is no government. Roads are all made and maintained by private companies between enclaves, and by each enclave within. Let's say I am the CEO of *AutoRaider Enclaves and High-Performance Automobiles Incorporated*, where we make cars. As the CEO, I want to sell more of our cars. How can I achieve this? 

One way would be to make better cars at a lower cost, sure, but that's hard. How about, instead, I make an acquisition: *Big Bob's Wide-Ass Motor Speedway and Paving Co.?* How about I then go around to other enclaves and make them a deal: "You need roads, I can make 'em. I love making roads. I'm **CRAZY** about roads. I'll make you a **CRAZY ROAD DEAL!** I'll give you 80% off the lowest price any of your competitors can make your roads for."

Naturally, they ask, "what's the catch?" 

"No catch! We'll even hook you up with our latest road design: the *UltraTracc Hyperspeed 2.0.™* We're just doing this because we love connection and creating communities. It's our mission to connect the entire world, after all\*." (\*Disclaimer: *AutoRaider Big Bob's Enclaves, Wide-Ass Motor Speedway and High-Performance Automobiles Amalgamated* reserves its right to not connect communities at its own discretion.)

After making a few more Offers That Cannot Be Refused™, we have a network of *UltraTracc Hyperspeed 2.0™* roads, made at cost to us. Cost is not profit. In fact, it's the opposite. CapEx is bad. The Board are angry with me. I find their lack of faith disturbing. 

As it turns out, the *UltraTracc Highspeed 2.0™* road design has a few hidden features. While it functions as a normal boring road for all other boring brands of cars, our models, equipped with groundbreaking (very proprietary) *UltraTraccc MegaPace RoadRipper 4™* technology, can levitate magnetically, go up to 20x faster and have no speed limit imposed on them. (Since there is no government, speed limits are imposed by the road operator's End User Terms of Service Agreement.)

Now it literally makes no sense for anyone within, or regularly using, the *UltraTracc Highspeed 2.0™* network to buy anything other than one of our cars. We can even do stuff like triple the cost of our models just because reasons. Money dance time. The Board are dancing. I'm dancing. MoneyParty™!

Social networks like Facebook benefit from a phenonmenon known in economics as [network externality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect). This is when the value of the service increases to every user as each new user joins. Everyone joins Facebook, and feels the need to stay on Facebook, because *everyone's on Facebook.* This is a well-understood mechanism which implies that, without any counterbalancing force, these systems are **inherently monopolistic**. Add to this the outsized ability for these companies to [acquire smaller networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook) with their large venture capital reserves, and we begin to see a problem.

> The company says the number of people who check Facebook daily has increased by 8 percent from this time a year ago, to 1.56 billion. The number of people who check Facebook monthly has also grown 8 percent, to 2.38 billion. The company says that even more of its business now relies on mobile, with 93 percent of all advertising revenues coming from its collection of mobile apps. Facebook now also breaks out the number of people who use at least one app in its broader ecosystem. “Around 2.7B people use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, or Messenger each month,” the company says. “On average, more than 2.1B people use one of our services every day.” \\

Facebook understands this better than anyone. This is why they're giving out [Free Basics](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internet-org/), a sort of Facebook-approved *internet-lite* for developing countries. The cost of providing free "internet" is far outweighed by the future profits they will accrue from possession of massive user-bases dependent on Facebook in these countries. Some are calling this *Digital Colonialism.* It sure does seem a bit unfair to any indigenous social media startups who can't afford to [fly internet-beaming drones everywhere](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/facebook-airbus-solar-drones-internet-program/), but that might just be me. And apparently India, where it has been [outlawed](https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10913398/free-basics-india-regulator-ruling). 

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 140px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/facebook-free-basics-developing-markets" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2017%2Fjul%2F27%2Ffacebook-free-basics-developing-markets&amp;key=7fae032dea7495502ccda6a3ac91d6de"></a></div></div><script async src="//cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Maybe it would be best if such companies are obliged to allow real, full-fat, open internet to travel along their tubes, regardless of whether they provide them for free or at cost? I think allowing a free ersatz internet is a Pandora's Box with not a lot of good things lurking inside. This concept is broadly referred to as [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality), and is a whole new can of worms that deserves its own post. 

<br />
### Decentralisation and Demonopolisation

I've made the argument that social networks are inherently monopolistic within their particular niche. Would anyone be crazy enough to make a new photo-sharing social app today?

I'm no great fan of the Senator from South Carolina, but his line of questioning here was well done, particularly in a hearing marked with comical technical ignorance and domain incompetence. 

#### An Important Note on Regulation

<br />
### Re-alignment of Incentivisation Structures

If the service needs to be free to its users, it needs to find an alternative means of funding. In the case of social media, this means ads. 

<br />
### A New Approach to Social Media Use 

It's not realistic to completely remove oneself from the digital realm, and even if it were possible, I certainly would not want to. While Facebook has drawn most of my negativity in this article, it's undeniable that positive results do come from its service. While banal, it's a truism that technology, and by extension social media, enables us to do good---and even great---things. The problem is not that the technology is bad, it's that we have fallen into the trap of technological over-optimism, where we underestimate or belittle the potential detrimental effects in view of the vast upside potential. (catalysed, no doubt, by powerful voices who happen to stand to gain greatly by the burgeoning valuations of their seed-stage investments) We need a new approach; a new paradigm of conscious, deliberate, value-based and balanced social media use, not complete withdrawral, prohibition or destruction. I also think this ties in nicely with some of the ideas I have about the future of computing, which I'll probably write about soon. It's safe to say that I feel social media as a whole tries too hard to transmogrify the real into the virtual, when the real is best left to be just that---real. We can find a better way to use social media if we keep this in mind, and I think the future of computing is one that successfully composities the real and virtual, getting the best of both, rather than going all-in on one paradigm. I can't take any credit for this idea; the incredible folks at [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) are making that future. 

<br />
### Divestment

Finally, we need to recognise that being a latent or active participant in these systems implies a tacit approval of such systems. If you find yourself agreeing with what has been written here, you have a duty to yourself to consider how much real value your participation in these systems is bringing to your life, and whether that value is worth harboring your congnitive dissonance. I don't mean to demand that you delete all of your social media this very minute, but rather that everyone participates in social media with full awareness and consciousness of its wider implications. 

<br />
## In Closing

### It Wasn't Always Like This

>Remember when the internet was fun? Remember when the idea of a social network — Facebook, even — was fun and awesome? Getting to look at pictures of your friends online? That fucking RULED. It’s mind-boggling to remember that at one point, Facebook was something that genuinely sparked joy. \\
>I’m mad that Facebook ruined a good thing by fucking up so much with constant privacy fumbles. I’m mad that it isn’t fun anymore, that instead of a place for a cool time with buddies it’s literally destabilizing democracy and enabling genocide. I’m mad that Facebook has diarrhea-shat all over itself so often that all reasonable people hate and distrust the company so much that no one in their right mind would EVER buy a Facebook video chatting machine, no matter how amazing and good it is. I’m mad that Twitter took a platform that’s the perfect joke vessel and let it become a place people don’t feel safe on. I’m mad Tumblr was left to die, I’m mad about Flickr, I’m mad that the promise of an internet that seemed bursting with possibilities turned out to be bursting with horrors. I’m angry that a million tiny bad things and wrong turns have happened to erode our trust in the internet, and now “the internet” is shorthand for “bad place.” Most of all I’m pissed that Facebook’s constant stream of unforced errors is ruining my ability to have a Good Time Online.\\

<br />
### It Doesn't Have to Be Like This

At the end of the day, this is a technological problem, which usually means there's an appropriate technological solution. Whether or not an appropriate technological solution comes about will depend on how much we want it, and how we reify that desire as praxis—whether that means by voting with our wallets, custom and data, writing to political representatives, voting, burn down shops, riots in the streets, all of that stuff. 

This isn't just a dicussion about where we get to post our holiday pictures. The information landscape of tomorrow's society is at stake, and information is power. There's trememdous hidden leverage in boring minutiae like formats, standards and regulations. No-one will be untouched by the consequences, for better or worse. Let's not mess this up. 

Don't hug me, I'm scared.

I call our modern environment "postmodern" in reference to the latent feeling I percieve from the rhetoric and results of Big Tech. While information systems, in theory, *should* have made it easier for the majority of people to get easier and faster access to a wider range of *facts,* as we now know, they also make it easier and faster to access a wider—more eye-catching—range of [alternative facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_facts). The optimistic, [counterculture](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/sites/mac/counter.html) hackers of the early web—one of whom was Steve Jobs—naiveley assumed (according to their oxymoronic socialist-libertarian ideology) that a sort of Smithian ["invisible hand"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand) of the info-market would cause the right information to out-compete the nonsense. (that libertarianism at play) We now know that, in an [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) where the service needs to be provided to the end user for "free" (that socialism at play) this doesn't necessarily happen, especially when bad actors deliberately attempt to subvert the system. This results in a situation where *facts* like, "the earth is round", ["there is no child sex dungeon in this pizza shop"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory) and ["vaccination is a statistically worthwhile medical procedure"](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/27/vaccines-mmr-fears-anti-vaxxers) begin to get called into [question](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/15/facebook-anti-vaccination-advertising-targeting-controversy), sometimes to [deadly effect](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/26/polio-worker-shot-dead-pakistan-third-killed-latest-vaccination/). Everyone is their own expert, armed with their own bias-confirming [cabal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)) of blogs and Facebook Groups and YouTubers. I think this constitutes a very postmodern environment, where [universalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalism) notions are being challenged, every type of institution and authority is being called into question and the barriers between opinion and truth are fading. 
I'm not against postmodernism; I'm very interested in the philosophy. But in this context, it's scary.
> Way back in the ’80s, we wanted everything to be free because we were hippie socialists. But we also loved entrepreneurs because we loved Steve Jobs. So you wanna be both a socialist and a libertarian at the same time, and it’s absurd. But that’s the kind of absurdity that Silicon Valley culture has to grapple with. \\
